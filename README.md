# OD_Balance

## Baseline Functions

The first code chunk loads in data provided from Network System.

Target Volumes, Input Volumes and Percentages from Streetlight.

The percentages from Streetlight have to be edited in excel to allow the data to be read correctly.

The OD balancing script balances each table.

Tables are then melted to allow for consumption by modelers.
